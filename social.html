         <h2 id=h3> Tips and Tricks! </h2>
        <p id="three"> Firstly, always try and remain authentic and true to yourself, no matter who you find yourself around. This can reduce the levels of anxiety and emotional restraint you may feel.  Secondly, attempts should be made to improve your ability to communicate your emotions and feelings without restraint— This can be very hard for many people, both men and women. However the majority of human interaction is based on communication, and severed communication causes severed social health. Another tip would be to find a balance between your social and personal time! Your balance is not going to look like everyone else’s! Do not be afraid to cancel plans if you have to!  Lastly, learn to lean on your friends and family for support. Make sure you have a good support system around you to support you during the tough times in life!  </p>
